There are 2 notebooks:
- Python Notebooks/Random Forest Training.ipynb: contains the code for training the model. It takes raw data as input and returns the metrics (R-squared, MSE, and feature importances by R-squared and F-measure methods) over time as a time series
- Python Notebooks/metrics_summary.ipynb:  takes the output of Random Forest Training.ipynb as input and plots summary charts/tables to track the R-squared, MSE, and feature importances over time

The link to the raw data can be found in [this google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12H8yWp4LxhZfLYBwciwQI_uVttAilgGI).
